                        SERMINSA, trade name and acronym of Servicios Mineros S.A. started activities in January 1974 as representative in Peru of important mining equipment manufacturers in Great Britain, the United States, Finland, etc. After several years of service, SERMINSA is consolidated as the main supplier of mining locomotives, traction batteries, mining lamps, transport equipment, drilling, etc.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Thus, it consolidates its leadership by implementing a well-implemented service and repairs workshop for mining equipment, which is then complemented to start the machinery manufacturing process. In 2006, SERMINSA acquired from PIKROSE LTD. of England the engineering of the designs of locomotives BEV (British Electric Vehicles), and initiates the process of manufacturing of the whole line of electric locomotives that currently work in the main mining companies of Peru, and also in countries of the region such as Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile. Then this line of locomotives is complemented with the complete line of wagons (mining cars) to complete the systems of extraction of minerals on rails.

                      <p>
                        In 2014, SERMINSA obtained the representation of EIMCO ELECON Ltd. of India, the original manufacturer of the EIMCO Pneumatic Blades line, as well as various mineral loading equipment, thus complementing its line of locomotives and wagons, offers complete loading and transport systems on rails.
